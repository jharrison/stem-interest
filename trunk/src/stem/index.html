<h2>STEM Interest Model</h2>
Designed by the Synergies team
<br>
Implemented by Joseph Harrison and Matthew Hendrey
</table>

<p>This model depicts the interest in the STEM fields among the youth of Parkrose School District in northern Portland, OR. 
Every 5th grader in the school district was surveyed and asked questions about their interest in different topics, 
what sort of activities they do, etc. The surveys are being repeated once per year through 8th grade.</p>

<p>The model is organized around activities in which the youth engage. When they participate in an activity,
their interest in that topic will go up or down depending on the circumstances. For example, if they have friends present,
they will be more likely to enjoy the activity and become more interested in the topic.
